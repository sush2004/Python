        "Pickling is useful for applications where we need some degree of persistency in  data. Our program's state data can be saved to disk, so we can continue working on it later on. It can also be used to send data over a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or socket connection, or to store python objects in a database. Pickle is very useful for when we're working with machine learning algorithms, where we want to save them to be able to make new predictions at a later time, without having to rewrite everything or train the model all over again.\r\n",

The same holds for different versions of Python itself. Unpickling a file that was pickled in a different version of Python may not always work properly, so we have to make sure that we're using the same version and perform an update if necessary. We should also try not to unpickle data from an untrusted source. Malicious code inside the file might be executed upon unpickling.\r\n"

        "1. Structured: It means data that can be processed, stored, and retrieved in a fixed format. It refers to highly organized information that can be readily and seamlessly stored and accessed from a database by simple search engine algorithms. For instance, the employee table in a company database will be structured as the employee details, their job positions, their salaries, etc., will be present in an organized manner. \r\n",

While in the past, data could only be collected from spreadsheets and databases, today data comes in an array of forms such as emails, PDFs, photos, videos, audios, SM posts, and so much more. It is one of the important characteristics of big data.\r\n",

Almost 43% of companies lack the necessary tools to filter out irrelevant data, which eventually costs them millions of dollars to hash out useful data from the bulk. Big Data tools can help reduce this, saving you both time and money\r\n",

        "4. Big Data analytics could help companies generate more sales leads which would naturally mean a boost in revenue. Businesses are using Big Data analytics tools to understand how well their products/services are doing in the market and how the customers are responding to them. Thus, the can understand better where to invest their time and money.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "5. With Big Data insights, you can always stay a step ahead of your competitors. You can screen the market to know what kind of promotions and offers your rivals are providing, and then you can come up with better offers for your customers. Also, Big Data insights allow you to learn customer behavior to understand the customer trends and provide a highly ‘personalized’ experience to them.\r\n",
